# Spark and Human Balance
As you have learned in this course Spark and AWS Glue allow you to process data from multiple sources, categorize the data, and curate it to be queried in the future for multiple purposes. In this project you will directly use the skills you have used, including some of the code you have already written.

You will go beyond that to write additional AWS Glue jobs to create curated step trainer data that can be used for machine learning.

# Project Introduction: STEDI Human Balance Analytics
In this project, you'll act as a data engineer for the STEDI team to build a data lakehouse solution for sensor data that trains a machine learning model.

# Project Details
The STEDI Team has been hard at work developing a hardware STEDI Step Trainer that:

trains the user to do a STEDI balance exercise;
and has sensors on the device that collect data to train a machine-learning algorithm to detect steps;
has a companion mobile app that collects customer data and interacts with the device sensors.
STEDI has heard from millions of early adopters who are willing to purchase the STEDI Step Trainers and use them.

Several customers have already received their Step Trainers, installed the mobile application, and begun using them together to test their balance. The Step Trainer is just a motion sensor that records the distance of the object detected. The app uses a mobile phone accelerometer to detect motion in the X, Y, and Z directions.

The STEDI team wants to use the motion sensor data to train a machine learning model to detect steps accurately in real-time. Privacy will be a primary consideration in deciding what data can be used.
